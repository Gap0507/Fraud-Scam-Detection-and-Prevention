#Problem Statement 
Problem Statement 3:
Multi-Channel Digital Arrest & Fraud Scam Detection and Prevention
Digital arrest scams are a rapidly growing cybercrime trend where fraudsters impersonate law
enforcement, government authorities, or financial institutions to coerce victims into making
immediate payments or disclosing sensitive personal information. Scammers use psychological
manipulation, spoofed caller IDs, AI-generated voices, deepfake videos, and fake documents
to create a sense of urgency and fear. The victims are threatened with “digital arrest,”
imprisonment, or legal consequences unless they comply.
These scams are increasingly sophisticated and difficult for the average user to detect.
Fraudsters exploit multiple communication channels: SMS, email, voice calls, video calls, and
social media—making detection even more challenging.
Problem
Existing prevention methods are reactive, relying mainly on public awareness campaigns, media
reporting, or user vigilance. These measures are insufficient against evolving tactics such as:
 Financial loss: Victims transfer large sums, sometimes their life savings.
 Erosion of trust: Legitimate government and banking communications lose credibility.
 Jurisdictional complexity: Transnational nature of scams makes prosecution difficult.
 AI-driven deception: Deepfake audio/video makes scams more believable, leaving victims
with little chance of distinguishing real vs. fake interactions.
There is a critical need for a proactive, intelligent, and multi-channel system that can detect
and flag potential digital arrest scams, including text, audio, and video fraud attempts. In realtime, empowering users with immediate alerts and protective measures.
Challenge
Build a proof-of-concept Multi-Channel Digital Fraud Detection and Prevention System that
can:
1. Ingest and Analyze Communication Data
 Text-based Data: Simulated SMS, email, chat transcripts.
 Voice-based Data: Caller ID, call metadata (duration, frequency), and speech-to-text
transcripts for keyword spotting.
 Video-based Data: Detect possible deepfake or manipulated content in video calls (e.g.,
AI-generated law enforcement officials).
2. Detect Scam Patterns using AI/ML
 Apply NLP techniques for text analysis and classification (legitimate vs. scam).
 Use keyword spotting & sentiment analysis to detect urgency, fear, and threats
Apply deepfake/voice spoofing detection models to flag synthetic audio or video.
 Perform sender/caller reputation analysis (e.g., suspicious email domains, spoofed
phone numbers).
 Build classification models that adapt and improve with user-reported suspicious
communications.
3. Real-Time Prevention & Alerts
 Trigger immediate, clear, and actionable alerts when potential scams are detected.
 Provide protective advice (e.g., “Do not share OTP,” “Verify caller ID via official website,”
“This video may be AI-generated, verify source”).
 Enable call blocking, email filtering, or warning overlays in real-time.
4. User-Friendly Interface
 A dashboard or mobile/web app that displays:
o Detected scam attempts with explanations.
o Highlighted keywords/phrases or deepfake indicators that triggered detection.
o Educational resources on common scam tactics.
 A manual reporting feature for users to submit suspicious communications and help
improve the detection model.
Requirements
 Data Simulation/Collection: Mock datasets for text, audio, and video communications
(including both legitimate and fraudulent examples).
 AI/ML Models:
o NLP models for scam text detection.
o Speech-to-text + audio deepfake detection models.
o Basic deepfake video detection techniques (e.g., blink rate, lip-sync mismatches, or
pretrained classifiers).
 Alerting Mechanism: Instant user notifications with context and recommendations.
 UI/UX: A simple interface (web app, CLI tool, or mobile simulation) for displaying alerts
and prevention tips.
 Explainability: Highlight risky patterns (phrases, audio markers, video inconsistencies) for
user trust.
 Deployable Prototype: A single runnable solution with setup instructions.


 Multi-Channel Fraud & Digital-Arrest Detection is dramatic, judge-friendly, and perfect for a solo who can crush the full-stack side. You don’t need to be an ML expert to win — you need a **rock-solid product**, a **visible AI layer**, and a **clean evaluation story**. Below I’ll give you a complete, practical blueprint you can execute in a hack: AI design you can implement with minimal training, the full-stack integration that will carry the demo, datasets + eval, a prioritized 36-hour plan, and a demo script.

# 1 — The one-line product

**FraudShield** — unified dashboard that ingests SMS / email / voice / video (simulated), flags likely “digital arrest” scams, explains why, and gives immediate mitigation actions (block/report/alert). The AI is visible and defensible, full-stack UX is the product.

---

# 2 — Why judges will love it

* Real human impact (prevent monetary and emotional harm).
* Multi-modal AI (text + audio + video) — shows breadth without heavy model training.
* Full-stack complexity: realtime ingestion, alerting, audit trail, role-based UI, analytics.
* Explainability & remediation: not just “red light” — it says why and what to do.

---

# 3 — High-level architecture (microservices)

```
[Client (React Next.js UI)]
       ↕ WebSocket / REST
[Backend API (Node/Express) — auth, RBAC, UI endpoints]
       ↕
[AI Service(s) (Python microservices)]
  - Text pipeline (NER + classifier)
  - Audio pipeline (STT + anti-spoof)
  - Video pipeline (frame extractor + deepfake flag)
       ↕
[Queue (Redis/Bull)]   [DB (Postgres + pgvector)]   [Object storage (S3)]
```

* Use WebSockets for live alerts (Socket.IO / Supabase Realtime).
* Host AI microservices as separate Docker containers (or run locally for demo).
* Keep all inference synchronous for small files, use background jobs for heavy video.

---

# 4 — Product UX / user flows (single primary flow)

1. **Simulated Multi-Channel Feed** (inbox): shows SMS, email, call logs, video thumbnails arriving in real time.
2. Click an item → **Inspection Panel**: full content, AI-score (risk 0–100), highlighted triggering tokens, audio waveform with flagged segments, video frames flagged with heatmap.
3. **Action Panel**: buttons — `Warn User`, `Block Sender`, `Report (generate email/CSV)`, `Escalate to Human`.
4. **Feedback**: Mark false positive / true positive → improves model offline.
5. **Analytics**: Trend charts (scam types, top senders, false positive rate) and audit logs.

Everything else in your ClinicMate CRM should be integrated: e.g., if a patient gets a scam alert, doctor can notify patient, or admin can export investigation packet.

---

# 5 — Minimal AI design philosophy for a solo/hack

Goal: **Visible, reproducible AI** that you can demo reliably.

* **No heavy training requirement**: rely on pretrained models and rule-based heuristics first.
* **Channelize AI effort**: 30–40% AI visibility — pipeline per channel: Text → Audio → Video.
* **Hybrid approach**: deterministic rules (high precision) + lightweight ML/zero-shot (improve recall).
* **Explainability**: always show the evidence (spans, timestamps, frames) — this sells more than raw AUC.

---

# 6 — Detailed AI pipeline (step-by-step)

### A — Text channel (SMS, email, chat)

1. **Preprocess**: normalize punctuation, expand contractions, remove signatures.
2. **Sender/Domain Reputation**: simple heuristics + lookup (simulate with a blocklist CSV + regex for spoofed domains).
3. **Zero-shot classifier** (fast, no training): HuggingFace `zero-shot-classification` (e.g., `facebook/bart-large-mnli`) with candidate labels `["scam", "phishing", "legitimate"]`.

   * Pros: fast to implement, no training required.
4. **Rules engine** (must): if message contains `("arrest","FIR","police","imprison*","immediate payment", "OTP","transfer now")` + urgency phrases → high risk.
5. **Explainability**: highlight triggering tokens, show TF-IDF top tokens, or use LIME/saliency for the classifier.
6. **Output**: `{channel: "text", score:0.87, triggers:["OTP","arrest"], explanation_spans:[{offsets...}]}`

> Quick code idea (zero-shot):

```python
from transformers import pipeline
zeroshot = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")
def classify_text(text):
    labels = ["scam", "legitimate"]
    out = zeroshot(text, candidate_labels=labels)
    return {"label": out["labels"][0], "score": out["scores"][0]}
```

### B — Voice channel (calls, voicemail)

1. **STT**: Whisper (small/medium) or any offline STT → produce transcript + timestamps.
2. **Text analysis**: run same text pipeline on transcript (detect urgency, threats).
3. **Voice spoofing detection** (anti-spoofing): two practical options for hack:

   * **Speaker verification**: if you have a claimed caller identity with known voice sample, compute embedding (ECAPA/Resemblyzer) and compare cosine similarity. Low similarity → suspicious.
   * **Pretrained anti-spoof models**: if available, run inference (ASVspoof). If not, use heuristics: abnormal pitch modulation, repeated segments, or unnatural pauses (extract features via librosa).
4. **Short explanation**: timestamped audio segment where the threat/OTP request appears; speaker mismatch score; STT text highlight.
5. **Output**: `{channel:"voice", stt: "pay now", spoof_score:0.76, text_score:0.91, evidence_ts:[(12.1,14.2)]}`

> Whisper usage (example):

```python
import whisper
model = whisper.load_model("small")
res = model.transcribe("call.wav")
transcript = res["text"]
```

### C — Video channel (video calls, whatsapp video)

1. **Frame extraction**: sample N frames (1–2 fps) using OpenCV.
2. **Face analysis**:

   * Run face-detector + face embedding extractor (FaceNet/MobileFaceNet).
   * Look for temporal inconsistency in face embeddings (jumps) — can indicate face swaps.
3. **Simple heuristics for deepfake signals**:

   * Blink rate detection (many deepfakes have unnatural blink patterns).
   * Lip-sync mismatch: align STT/timecodes with mouth movement energy. If transcript says “transfer” but mouth not moving, suspicious.
4. **Pretrained deepfake classifier**: if GPU available and model ready, run inference (FaceForensics++ models). If not, combine heuristics for a demo.
5. **Output**: `{channel:"video", deepfake_score:0.6, frame_index:45, explanation:"low blink rate + lip-sync mismatch"}`

### D — Fusion & Final Decision

* Normalize scores to \[0,1]. Use weighted sum or a small logistic model (trainable quickly on synthetic labels) to combine:

  ```
  final_score = w_text*text_score + w_voice*voice_score + w_video*video_score + w_reputation*rep_score
  ```
* Calibrate threshold for high precision (e.g., final\_score > 0.8 = block, 0.5–0.8 = warn).

### E — Feedback loop

* User marks `False Positive` or `Confirm Scam`. Log labeled examples; retrain offline after hack to show improvement (present a before/after in slides).

# 7 — Datasets & how to get data quickly

You don’t need to collect private data; use public/simulated datasets.

**Text**

* UCI SMS Spam Collection (classic).
* Enron Email dataset (for legitimate email style).
* Kaggle phishing email / phishing URL datasets for domain heuristics.

**Audio**

* ASVspoof datasets (for anti-spoof research).
* VoxCeleb for voice samples (speaker embeddings).
* You can also record simulated calls yourself (have friends read scam templates) — very quick.

**Video**

* FaceForensics++ (public deepfake dataset).
* Short sample videos from free datasets (use only for detection).

**Synthetic approach (recommended for hack):**

* Write 200 synthetic scam messages (templates: police arrest, bank OTP, tax notice).
* Create voice recordings with a phone voice (record yourself) saying the scripts.
* Fake “legit” messages from bank newsletters/newsletters.
* This is enough for a convincing demo and to report detection metrics.

---

# 8 — Metrics and evaluation (what to show to judges)

* **Text classifier**: Precision / Recall / F1 on a small holdout (20–50 labeled texts).
* **Voice spoof detection**: ROC AUC or detection rate on your spoof vs real set.
* **Video deepfake detection**: True positive rate on a small sample.
* **System metrics**: Avg latency per item (ms or s), throughput.
* **Operational metric**: False positive rate — emphasize you tuned for **precision** (show tradeoff).
* **Human evaluation**: show number of correct labels vs human reviewer on gold set (50 cases).

Judges want numbers + a live demo that matches those numbers.

# 9 — Full-stack features to build (60% of your effort)

You already own ClinicMate CRM — now make FraudShield feel like a product:

Priority features (must ship):

1. **Real-time multi-channel inbox** (WebSocket stream of incoming SMS/email/calls/videos).
2. **Per-item inspector** with evidence highlights (text spans, audio waveform + seek, video frame with mark).
3. **Action panel**: `Warn`, `Block`, `Report` (creates an exportable case file).
4. **Feedback / labelling UI** (false positive / confirm) to collect supervised labels.
5. **Alerts & subscriptions**: ability to subscribe patients/doctors to high-risk alerts.
6. **Audit logs & export**: download CSV/ZIP of items per patient for authority submission.
7. **Admin analytics**: trending scam types, top senders, FP rate.

Nice-to-have / judges-impressive (if time):

* Automated generation of a “case packet” (PDF) for reporting to bank/police.
* Role-based view (doctor vs admin vs investigator).
* Simulated “call blocking” demo: clicking Block prevents future simulated events from that number.

---

# 10 — 36-hour solo roadmap (prioritized, timeboxed)

This is aggressive but doable for a strong full-stack dev:

**Hour 0–1 (setup)**

* Repo + branches, create `ai_service/` skeleton (FastAPI), create `frontend/` Next.js inbox skeleton.
* Prepare sample datasets (20–50 text + 10 audio + 5 video).

**Hour 1–3 (quick wins)**

* Implement text zero-shot classifier and a simple rules engine. Hook to backend endpoint `/scan/text`.
* Frontend: upload text/email + show risk & highlighted tokens.

**Hour 3–6 (voice path)**

* Add Whisper STT pipeline + feed STT output to text pipeline. Display waveform + timestamps.
* Implement speaker embedding mismatch demo with resemblyzer/ECAPA and show similarity score.

**Hour 6–10 (video path minimal)**

* Implement frame extraction + simple heuristic (blink detection / mouth movement) or run a pretrained deepfake inference if available. Show flagged frame.

**Hour 10–14 (fusion & scoring)**

* Implement score fusion and thresholding. Store full results in Postgres.
* Add WebSocket notifications when a new item is flagged.

**Hour 14–20 (UX & actions)**

* Build inspector page with evidence, action buttons, and feedback.
* Implement case export (ZIP/PDF).

**Hour 20–26 (analytics & admin)**

* Build analytics page with charts (top senders, counts).
* Add feedback label collection and a small offline retraining script (train a logistic reg on the features you log).

**Hour 26–32 (polish & deploy)**

* Dockerize AI service; deploy backend (Render) + frontend (Vercel). Test end-to-end on sample feed.
* Record backup demo video (2 minutes).

**Hour 32–36 (demo prep)**

* Prepare slides, show key metrics, rehearse live demo script, prepare contingency (video).

# 11 — Practical code snippets & tips (copy/paste ready)

**Zero-shot text classifier**

```python
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model="facebook/bart-large-mnli")
def text_flag(text):
    labels = ["scam", "phishing", "legitimate"]
    res = classifier(text, labels)
    return {"top_label": res["labels"][0], "score": res["scores"][0], "all": dict(zip(res["labels"],res["scores"]))}
```

**Whisper STT**

```python
import whisper
model = whisper.load_model("small")
res = model.transcribe("call.wav")
transcript = res["text"]
```

**Speaker verification (Resemblyzer quick)**

```python
from resemblyzer import VoiceEncoder, preprocess_wav
from pathlib import Path
enc = VoiceEncoder()
wav_f = "caller.wav"
wav_known = "claimed_owner.wav"
emb1 = enc.embed_utterance(preprocess_wav(wav_f))
emb2 = enc.embed_utterance(preprocess_wav(wav_known))
import numpy as np
sim = np.dot(emb1, emb2)/(np.linalg.norm(emb1)*np.linalg.norm(emb2))
# sim < 0.6 → suspicious (example threshold)
```

**Frame extraction (OpenCV)**

```python
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("call.mp4")
fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
frame_rate = int(fps)  # sample every frame_rate frames, or every N seconds
i = 0
frames = []
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret: break
    if i % (fps*1) == 0:   # 1 fps
        frames.append(frame)
    i += 1
cap.release()
```

Use these for your `ai_service` microservice endpoints.

# 12 — Evaluation & judge storytelling (what to show)

* **Numbers**: Precision (text), AUC (audio spoof), detection rate (video) on your curated gold set.
* **Ablation**: Text-only vs Text+Voice vs All three — show how fusion improves recall.
* **Explainability**: Click an alert, show the highlighted evidence that triggered it.
* **Real-time**: Show a stream of simulated events and a blocked number (after block, no more events).
* **Audit**: Download a PDF “case packet” ready to be sent to bank/regulator.

Script: 90s hook (real story) → live demo (upload/paste/call) → metrics + ablation + Q\&A.

---

# 13 — Safety, ethics & legal notes

* **Privacy**: Always show “simulated data” for demo. For real privacy, encrypt PII, store logs securely, and only process data with consent.
* **False positives**: Provide human escalation path; never auto-punish/charge without human review.
* **Deepfake limits**: Explain your detector is an early warning — recommend human verification.

---

# 14 — Quick checklist for the first 30 minutes (start now)

* `git init` + create readme + issue board (tasks).
* Yarn/npm create Next.js frontend skeleton + simple inbox page.
* Create `ai_service` venv, `pip install transformers whisper resemblyzer librosa opencv-python fastapi uvicorn`.
* Drop in 30 sample text messages (20 scam, 10 legit), 5 sample voice files, 2 short videos.
* Implement the zero-shot pipeline + `/scan/text` endpoint and connect it to frontend — get a single end-to-end flow working ASAP.

---

# 15 — Final tactical tips (to maximize judge impression)

* **Polish the UI**: animated card arrival, red/yellow/green chips, copy that explains the risk in plain English.
* **Demonstrate control**: show “block” prevents later simulated items — very visceral.
* **Evidence first**: judges want to see the snippet/frame that caused the flag.
* **Be honest** in your pitch — “hybrid rules + pretrained models, focused on precision, with a feedback loop.” That sounds credible and engineered.

If you want, I can immediately:

1. Generate the **FastAPI AI service** scaffold with endpoints for text/voice/video (with the zero-shot + Whisper + resemblyzer snippets included).
2. Generate the **Next.js inbox component** that streams simulated items and displays the evidence panel.
3. Produce the **36-hour checklist** as a Trello-style task list you can paste into your project.

Which one do you want me to output first — the AI service scaffold (Python + endpoints) or the frontend inbox component (Next.js)? I’ll drop runnable code and instructions for immediate use.
